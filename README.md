# WaterContentEstimationInSoil
This project aims to detect the water content in soil by performing image processing on the image and estimating the wet and dry pixels of that image. An image of a wet soil patch will have more darker pixels(pixel values close to 255 in a grayscale image) as compared to a dry soil patch. The amount of darker pixels might vary according to the different types of soil.
